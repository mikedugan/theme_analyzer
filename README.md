Theme Analyzer
=============

This is a simple Ruby script that will read multiple CSS files passed in from the command line and generate an analysis of the colors used.

###Usage
    ruby theme.rb main.css somethingElse.css
This will generate output files `mainOutput.html` and `somethingElseOutput.html`. The display is a simple grid with a sampling of the color and number of occurences.
